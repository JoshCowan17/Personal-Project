# Personal-Project
Choose a project that interests you from https://sites.google.com/view/prof-v/programming/projects  (Links to an external site.)or propose a similar project related to computer science / programming. 

You are expected to spend at least 2-3 hours outside of class on this project per week for the next 12 weeks. Keep a log of how much time you spent on the project and what you learned. 

Save everything to GitHub and submit a link to your repository once a month.

For this week, create a problem statement with the following components:

Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)
Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)
Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)
Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system)
Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)
Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)
Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs)


Week 1:
  Went over basic concepts of "Why people should program"
    People should program because learning how to "talk" to computers will become more and more valuable. They help us do
    mundane tasks humans do not find as fulfilling. For instance, the textbook talks about how we are much more adept at
    comprehending text, while a computer is better at counting the most used words in x amount of paragraphs.
   
  Week 1 is very basic and has very little coding involved. The only other concept the professor goes over is how important
  it is to become a good mentor. Being a teacher of code and helping others improves your coding skill as a whole. Also coding
  is odd. The concepts are not innately hard. It is the little things that a person has already struggled to learn coding
  can teach. So helping and getting help for coding is a great asset
  
  Week 2:
    Week 2 is only about the installing and using python. 
    
    Week 2 of COP we went over arithmetic expressions
    print (16+3) = 19
    print (16-3) = 13
    print (16*3) = 48
    print (16**3) = 4096
    print (16/3) = 5.33
    print (16//3) = integor division
    print (16%3) = 1 (remainder)
    
   Week 3:
    Week 3 is about finishing up the overview, chapter 1, in order to grasp what programming is. Big takeaways for me are,
    the emphasis that things can go wrong, programs are (like stated in class) crafted to solve a problem, and these solutions
    can save a great deal of time.
    The assignment for the week is "Hello World"
    print ("Hello World")
    
   Week 4:
    Week 4 goes over arithmetic experessions like COP does in week 2. 
    Things to note:
      x+1=x makes sense in programming, but obviously not in math. This is called an increment.
      
   Week 5:
    Week 5 is on how computers make decisions.
    Raptor is an app to show a tree of decision making. The chapter was all about this process. Tabs are important to keep track
    of because the computer goes in a very systematic order. The professor actually thinks that using spaces exclusively will help
    This gets a little tricky when loops are involved, but the idea stays the same. They 
   
   x = 5
   if x > 2 :
      print ('Bigger than 2')
      print ('Still bigger')
   print ('Done with 2')
   
   for i in range (5) :
       print (i)
       if i > 2:
            print ('Bigger than 2')
       print ('Done with i', i)
    print ('All Done')
    
    The stuff within the if statement is conditional code, while the print statement after, is sequential code.
    Then we hit nested code at line 68. 
    
    Week 6:
      Functions are the topic of week 6. 
      Boolean expressions and functions
     
grade = int(input("Enter your grade:"))
 if grade >= 90:
 print ("Very Good!")
elif grade >= 80:
 print ("Good!")
elif grade >= 70:
 print ("Fair")
elif grade >= 60:
 print ("Satisfactory")
else:
 print ("Poor")
